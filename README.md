## Guide
Touchscreen is supported in most places.\
On first open, you'll need to create a folder and a topic for your notes. You can press <kbd>X</kbd> in the menus to do that. To enter a folder or a topic, press <kbd>A</kbd>.\
While drawing, you can always check the usage guide by pressing <kbd>Y</kbd>. There's not much to know other than that, so hope you find this useful for taking notes!\
